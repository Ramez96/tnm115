==============================

This solution contains two directories:
    * `tnm115-sus-client`: the HTML, CSS, and JS based client interface developed throughout Lessons 1-3 (previously named tnm115-sus), and extended in Lesson 4
    * `tnm115-sus-server`: the Node.js based server developed throughout Lesson 4

By default, the server runs at
http://127.0.0.1:3000

To start the server, navigate using your operating system's command line interface (Windows: cmd.exe; Mac OS / Unix: Terminal) to `tnm115-sus-server`
(recommended: utilize the Visual Studio Code integrated Terminal), and run the command:
`node app.js`

Open the client interface, i.e., the `sus.html` file in the `tnm115-sus-client` directory, in the browser (recommended: Firefox).

Utilize the browser's developer tools (inspector, console, network) for any further examination / debugging.
